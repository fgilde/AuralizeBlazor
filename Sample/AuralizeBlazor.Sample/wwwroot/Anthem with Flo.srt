1
00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:18,357
Toast to the knights that left our voices sore Arm in arm with mischief in our eyes

2
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:24,126
Every song a bond, our spirits high Stomping feet, we own this fight

3
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:29,761
Hearts ablaze, we unite every sound Journey on from dusk till dawn

4
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:38,557
We're bound Raise your pints up, friends of mine

5
00:00:38,651 --> 00:00:44,797
Yeah, flow, you're always by my side We're not gonna fret, not one small doubt

6
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:50,566
Every tale's a crack with you about We're gonna shred some strings, stage a light

7
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,076
Screaming anthems through the night We are now

8
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:10,954
Now we march to the beat of our drum Thrashing harder, come what may come

9
00:01:11,048 --> 00:01:16,320
We're the kings of this emerald town With every uproar, we claim the crown

10
00:01:16,414 --> 00:01:22,479
Leaning in as the crowd roars loud Flow and I in this raucous crowd

11
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:50,317
Through the tavern doors, our legend grows Stout hearts entwine like Celtic knots, who knows?

12
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:56,154
Every shanty, every cheer we compose Flow, you're the maids who always toast

13
00:01:56,248 --> 00:02:01,923
Through the tavern doors, our legend grows Stout hearts entwine like Celtic knots, who knows?

14
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:10,476
Every shanty, every cheer we compose Flow, you're the maids who always toast
